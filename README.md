# Architecture Design

## Package and class diagram (UML), documenting (describing) each class' responsibility:

- #### Minion Jump
Encharge of game logic. This is the main class.
- #### Entity
This class defines all the characteristics common to all entities of the game.
- #### Villain
This class defines the behavior of the villain.
- #### Minion
This class defines the behavior of the minion (character moved by the user).
- #### Platform
This class define platforms where minion walks.
- #### PlatformBehavior
Responsible to behavior of the platform.
- #### NormalPlatform
Class responsible for normals platforms.
- #### SpringPlatform
Class responsible for platforms with springs. This type of platform is where minion achieve more height with help of spring.
- #### SplitPlatform
Class responsible for split platforms. This type of platform breaks down and the minion ends up falling.
- #### RocketPlatform
Class responsible for platforms with rockets. This type of platform is where minion achieve more height than platform with spring, with help of rocket.

## Design of behavioural aspects:

## Design Patterns:
1. Singleton - for the main game class.
2. Strategy - for the different types of platforms: platform with spring, with rocket or normal and split platform.

# GUI Design
## Listing of the main functionalities:
1. The game will be playable in Single Player.
2. The game keeps scores of single player game runs.
3. The settings of the game will allow for a player to turn off the sound in the game.

# Test Design
## Listing of the expected final test cases:
1. Test randomness of the platform.
2. Test out-of-bounds behaviour.
3. Test player losing.
4. Test randomness movement of the villain.
5. Test highscore saving.
